# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

  Each row must have a unique way of identifying itself to other parts of the program. Primary keys are guaranteed to be unique, and are how we identify individual rows.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST is a pattern to follow when structuring routes between the server and the client. "RESTful routes" are an attempt to bring the operations that can be applied to an object into HTTP requests.

2. JSON: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. 

3. ERB: Embedded Ruby processes combined Ruby/HTML code, translating it to pure HTML so it can be used in the browser.

4. Params: URL parameters, also known as params or query strings, are a way to pass in additional information into a controller method to query the database or dynamically modify the view.

5. API: stands for Application Programming Interface wherein the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses.
